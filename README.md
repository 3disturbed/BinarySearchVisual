## Introduction

Binary Search is a fundamental algorithm used to efficiently find a target value within a **sorted** array. By repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, it quickly narrows down the possible locations of the target value, making it much faster than a linear search, especially for large datasets.

This visualization tool provides a step-by-step graphical representation of the Binary Search algorithm, allowing you to interactively see how it works internally.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch how the search interval narrows down with each step.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Control the speed of the visualization to better understand each operation.
- **Educational**: Great for students and anyone interested in learning how Binary Search works.

## Understanding Binary Search

Binary Search works on the principle of divide and conquer. Here's a brief overview:
The intention of the algorithm is to halve the potential options every step.

## Applications

- **Databases**: Quickly searching for records.
- **Libraries**: Looking up books or resources.
- **Gaming**: Collision detection and resource management.
- **Networking**: Routing and IP address management.
